# Self-Case-Study--Ashrae-Great-Energy-Predictor-3.-
A Self Case Study On the Kaggle Competition held in 2019- Ashrae Great Energy Predictor 3. 
To cut costs, emissions, and energy consumption, major investments have been made to increase the energy efficiency of buildings. The building owner pays the difference between the actual quantity of energy used and what would have been utilised if efficiency enhancement procedures weren't used. The machine learning model provided the latter values. We predict the future energy demand based on the past energy use of more than 1400 buildings over the course of a year. To understand the cost and energy savings, this will then be compared to the actual energy usage with efficiency method.
